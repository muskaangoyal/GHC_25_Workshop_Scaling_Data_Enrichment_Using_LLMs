        "Welcome! In this notebook, we will build a data enrichment pipeline using a real-estate dataset to convert basic numerical housing features into semantic signals (e.g., coffee access, food corridor, transit convenience, neighborhood vibe). We will then rebuild retrieval on top of those enriched signals to show how search suddenly becomes aligned with the way humans actually ask questions.\n",
